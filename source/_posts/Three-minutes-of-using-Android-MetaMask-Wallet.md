# 1. Download MetaMask Wallet
- You can quickly download and use the APK installation package that I have already downloaded from the official website. The download address is:[MetaMask](/upload/MetaMask_Android.apk)ï¼›
- Official download method: Google search MetaMask on your own for download;

Both are possible. It is recommended to download the official APK I provided and search for it on your own to easily download a fake wallet.

# 2. Download, Install, and Use

## Step 1: Create a wallet

Enter the login password for the device and remember it yourself, as MetaMask Wallet will not remember the password. Once forgotten, it will not be able to retrieve the password and login to the device, so be sure to remember it.

## Step 2: Generate mnemonics

This is a mnemonic generated by MetaMask Wallet, which is equivalent to your ID card. This mnemonic is more important than the previous device and must not be lost. So after generating, please handwrite it into a notebook or local text in your notebook. Do not use online documents or online drives or other applications, as this is very dangerous and unsafe.

A mnemonic word is equivalent to an individual's ID card. If a mnemonic word is lost and the device login password is forgotten, congratulations. The money in your wallet will not be able to be retrieved, and it is completely impossible to retrieve it. Therefore, it is important to remember to save your mnemonic word and not tell others your own mnemonic word.

## Step 3: Verify mnemonics

This step is to verify your mnemonic words from the previous step, with the aim of saving them. Fill in the boxes one by one according to the order of the mnemonic words displayed in the previous step, and after successful verification, proceed to the next step, which is the wallet page.
